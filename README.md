## Abstract

<div align="left">

Gait recognition, a growing field in biological recognition technology, utilizes distinct walking patterns for accurate individual identification. However, existing methods lack the incorporation of temporal information. To reach the full potential of gait recognition, we advocate for the consideration of temporal features at varying granularities and spans. This paper introduces a novel framework, **GaitGS**, which aggregates temporal features simultaneously in both **granularity** and **span** dimensions. Specifically, the **Multi-Granularity Feature Extractor (MGFE)** is designed to capture micro-motion and macro-motion information at fine and coarse levels respectively, while the **Multi-Span Feature Extractor (MSFE)** generates local and global temporal representations. Through extensive experiments on two datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving **Rank-1 accuracy of 98.2\%, 96.5\%, and 89.7\% on CASIA-B** under different conditions, and **97.6\% on OU-MVLP**.

## Usage

<div align="left">

### 1. Training

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 opengait/main.py --cfgs ./configs/gaitgs/gaitgs.yaml --phase train --log_to_file
```
or
```shell
sh train.sh
```


### 2. Testing

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3 torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 opengait/main.py --cfgs ./configs/gaitgs/gaitgs.yaml --phase train --log_to_file
```
or
```shell
sh test.sh
```


  Note: You can find the corresponding .yaml file in `./configs/` , where you can adjust the configurations for training and testing. Additionally, you can refer to the commands provided in `train.sh` and `test.sh`.
